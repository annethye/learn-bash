# Learn the Command Line and Linux Bash Scripting
This repository contains my project solutions for the [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) and  [Introduction to Linux: Bash Scripting](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-linux-bash-scripting) courses on codecademy.

## Projects
### Navigating the File System
#### [Bicycle World](bicycle_world.md)
> A command line practice project using a simulated bicycle shop file system. It covers directory navigation, listing contents, and creating, organising, and managing files and directories.

### Veiwing and Changing the File System
#### [Artusi](artusi.md)
> A command line project focused on file system navigation and manipulation within a simulated art supply store. It includes listing contents, using wildcards and flags, and copying, moving, and deleting files and directories.

### Redirecting Input and Output
#### [Athletica](athletica.md)
> A project to practice standard input/output streams, pipelines and text manipulation in a simulated sporting events file system. Tasks include redirecting and appending output, piping between commands, filtering duplicates, searching across files, and performing simple substitutions.

### Configuring the Environment
#### [Attica](attica.md)
> A command line project focused on configuring the terminal environment including editing the bash profile, creating aliases, setting environment variables, and customising the command prompt within a simulated clothing store workflow.

#### [Lingua Franca](lingua_franca.md)
> A comprehensive command line practice project centred on managing a simulated translation service file system. It covers directory navigation, file organisation, wildcards, redirection and pipelines, text processing, and shell environment configuration, including aliases and prompt customisation.

### Linux Bash Utilities
#### [Compressing NASA's Media Files](compressing_nasa_media_files.md)
> A command line project focused on downloading, organising, compressing, and archiving media files. Using a simulated NASA media workflow, it covers network checks, archive extraction, file organisation by type, and compression with gzip, bzip2, xz, and tar.

### Bash Scripting
#### [Build a Build Script](build_a_build_script.md)
> A Bash build and release scripting project that generates a clean build/ directory from a source tree. It reads a version string from changelog.md, prompts the user to continue, copies selected files while excluding sensitive content, and prints a build summary, exercising conditionals, user input handling, and file operations in Bash.

### Practise Bash Scripting in Linux
#### [What's the Hottest City](hottest_city.md)
> A Bash scripting project that uses a custom weather.sh script to fetch temperature data for multiple cities, store the results in a file, and sort them by temperature. It practises arrays, loops, command substitution, file redirection, and basic text processing to determine the hottest city from the command line.
